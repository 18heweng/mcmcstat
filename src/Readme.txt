Source code for mex routines for Matlab for some statistical
calculations. Most of the 'mcmcstat' m code should work without these.
No guarantee give. Usually, running these mex files from Matlab will
result to program crashes and loss of data. I have forgotten the
original source of most of these files, sorry.
